/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS/SCSS files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement. It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.
